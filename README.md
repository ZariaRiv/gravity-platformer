# Game-Design-11
A project developed for the course Design for Game and Play in autumn 2022. By group of students from Eindhoven Univeristy of Tehcnology and Tilburg University. The game is a puzzle platformer in which you have to take the role of an assitiant proffesor in a physics department and go on an adventure through dimensions!
There are differen dimensions that you will encounter in your journey:

green- normal one

a dimension where you can jump higher! like on the moon. 

![inverted_dimension](https://github.com/ZariaRiv/gravity-platformer/assets/114955463/ac5417be-38ea-4c16-98a3-443b0bd91dca)

dimansion with inverted gravity
and also a dimension where you are smaller than usual.

All the dimensions may come hanmdy in your journey but you need to use the divice that switch them with caution. It can have side effects!

# current state of the game
The game for does not have any kind of in game rewards other than completing the level and also the side effects for using the dimension switching device or any restrictions for it are not implemented. In the future a timed version of levels will be added. 
The game is still playable and so feel free to download it and try it out! 

# Katarzyna KlÄ™czek contribution
my main role in the tema was level design,  I treid to come with levels that would first introduce and teach the player to use the new mechanics and then challenge the player by next level when they have to combine all the mechanics known so far. Placments of the block, obstacles and portals.
